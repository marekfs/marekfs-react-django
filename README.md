Easiest way to install and run is to use Docker. Make sure you have [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/) and [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

### WIP

##### Starting

`git clone https://github.com/marekfs/marekfs-react-django`

In the root directory, run `docker-compose up`.
